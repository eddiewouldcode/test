Groove Monkee Extras Download

This download does NOT contain loops but it has other items that may make your life easier. These include:

1. Drum maps for Sonar, Cubase, Reaper, Acid, etc.
2. NI Battery 3 Kits to use with our "GM Mapped" midi loops. Instructions are included in the folder named "Battery". 
3. NI Battery 3 kit for Afro-Cuban Percussion (Expanded Afro-Cuban Kit).


We occasionally update these items and add more so check the download area every so often. If we've updated the file since your last download, you'll see "New update" and the current release date.
